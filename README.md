This project is made in 3 days so there're a lot more to complete. The account managing function is not working currently, I may call it as  a WIP (work in progress). 
Feel free to use for your own purposes, just in case you don't know, you have to change the firebase.js file in the Congfig folder for your own projects. Thanks for reading. <br>
This project has been hosted by using firebase CLI connected with Github. You can access the web via this link: https://overread-12.web.app

This is the very first web I make for hosting so it looks like shit. 
Upcoming: I'm planning on recreating this project to become a web for drawing database figures and related stuff.
